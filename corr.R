### assumption: a folder called 'specdata' exists in the working directory
### assumption: 'specdata' contains 332 csv files, in NNN.csv format

corr <- function(directory, threshold = 0) {
  ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
  ## the location of the CSV files
  
  ## 'threshold' is a numeric vector of length 1 indicating the
  ## number of completely observed observations (on all
  ## variables) required to compute the correlation between
  ## nitrate and sulfate; the default is 0
  
  ## Return a numeric vector of correlations
